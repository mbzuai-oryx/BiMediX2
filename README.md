## 	üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Overview


Introducing **BiMediX2**, the first bilingual (Arabic-English) Bio-Medical Expert Large Multimodal Model (LMM) designed for advanced medical image understanding and applications. Built on the Llama 3.1 architecture, BiMediX2 seamlessly integrates text and visual modalities to enable multilingual interactions, including text-based queries and multi-turn conversations involving medical images. Trained on a diverse bilingual and multimodal healthcare dataset of 1.6M samples, it achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks. BiMediX2 outperforms recent models in multimodal medical evaluations, delivering over 9% improvement in English and 20% in Arabic evaluations, and excelling in tasks like medical VQA, Report Generation, and Summarization.
